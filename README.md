### Glad to see you here🫠!!


I am a Master's student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Delhi University. I recently completed my Bachelor of Science from Maharaja Agrasen College, Delhi University in 2023. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). My thirst for knowledge extends to advanced mathematical concepts, including Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Calculus.
